This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The frontend for the app exists in `pages/index.tsx`.

API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/policies](http://localhost:3000/api/policies)
There are get and post routes set up for testing frontend calls.

Api routes do not save data. localStorage is used to assist with the simulation of saving and retrieving data from a backend.
